# Deep-Fake-Detection

We have witnessed great technological advancement in Deep Generative models like Gen3 erative Adversarial Networks(GANs) to generate state of the art high resolution images in recent years. This has fueled the creation of fake content which is threat to our privacy, democracy and national security. This fake content is referred to as DeepFakes. In this project, we propose a model to effectively classify between real and fake images.The model architecture implemented is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The real images dataset is the imagewoof dataset while the fake images are generated by Spectrally Normalized Generative Adversarial Networks (SNGANs) followed by Bicubic, Bilinear and Pixel Shuffle upsampling.

We have used Convolutional Neural Network architecture with three convolution layers, one max polling layer. We have also performed batch normalization. Batch normalization layer is used for normalization and scaling for inputs from previous layer. It makes training of network more faster and stable (6). The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is used for all the convolution layers. ReLU function is used over other activation function is because it does not active all the neurons at the same time. The computational efficiency of the function is much higher than others becauseonly specific neurons are activated (7). The vanishing gradient problem arising in sigmoid and tanh activation can be easily overcome by ReLU. After the convolution layers, we added a fully connected layer at the end. The two nodes in final dense layer in the architecture proposed are used for two finalclasses (real and fake) The sigmoid activation is used at the last dense layer for classification as the sigmoid outputs between 0 and 1. If the sigmoid output is close to zero then the image is classified as fake and if the sigmoid outpout is close to one that the image is classified as real.
